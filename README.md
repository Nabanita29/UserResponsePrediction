# UserResponsePrediction

# Project Title

This project aims to predict the likelihood of users clicking on online advertisements using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information on users' daily time spent on a site, age, area income, daily internet usage, and gender. We preprocess the data by extracting datetime features and perform feature engineering to enhance model performance. We then build and evaluate three different classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The project is part of the Ineuron.ai internship and demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation techniques for ad click prediction..
